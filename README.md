### Installs a fresh server with
[![Centos version](https://img.shields.io/badge/CentOS-8-blue)](https://github.com/rvwoens/centos-laravel-stack)
[![PHP version](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.4-blue)](https://github.com/rvwoens/centos-laravel-stack)

* CentOS 
* Nginx and virtual hosts
* Php fpm & cli, composer  
* Node, npm, yarn
* Redis 
* Basic security 
* Add (multiple) laravel projects (any laravel version) with Zero-Downtime deployment 

The scripts are all bash, and kept very simple so you can tweak them to your needs if you want to.

Very easy project deployment by calling the project's  ```puller``` script   

### how to install

* bring up a bare centos 8 server somewhere
* ssh as root and run:

```bash
yum -y install tar
curl -s -L https://github.com/rvwoens/centos-laravel-stack/archive/v1.0.43.tar.gz | tar -xz
cd centos-laravel-stack-1.0.43
./setup_full
```

That's it. Now you can add laravel apps:

### Add a new laravel app with Zero Downtime Deployment
Log in as the default (created) user and run
```
    addzhost <<domain>> <<git repository>> <<initial tag>>
```

#### Note:
You need access privileges from this server on the repository. 
- For github or gitlab, Go to settings->ssh keys and add the contents of ```~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``` to a new ssh key.

#### Example:
    
```$ addzhost myapp.example.com git@gitlab.com:myprojects/myapp.git v1.0.3```        
Now you can browse to myapp.example.com and enjoy your v1.0.3 release (make sure DNS has been set up)


- adds ```/var/www/myapp.example.com``` for the laravel app (make sure to configure DNS to the IP of this server)
- creates a nginx config in ```/etc/nginx/sites-available``` and enables it
- creates ```/var/www/myapp.example.com/releases``` dir for each inidividual release
- creates ```/var/www/myapp.example.com/storage``` dir which is linked into each release
- creates (stub) ```/var/www/myapp.example.com/.env``` file which is linked into each release. Tweak this to your needs.


- generates a ```puller``` script (in /var/www/myapp.example.com) to pull a version (tag) from the repository and release it
- generates a ```rollback``` script to roll back to a previous release (any of the releases available in the releases dir)
- uses ```puller``` to release the initial tag into production. if it fails you can rollback everything and try again.

#### puller 
Usage: ```$ /var/www/[domain]/puller [tag]```

Puller is generated by addzhost on the top project directory: ```/var/www/[domain]/puller```

- Creates a new release in the releases directory and uses ```git archive``` to download the release
- create symbolic links of ```/var/www/[domain]/storage``` and ```/var/www/[domain]/.env``` into the release
- runs ```composer install```
- You can create a custom post-deployment script in the root of your repository called ```after_deploy``` with your own artisan/composer/npm commands.
a typical after_deploy could look like this 
    ```
    echo "DEPLOY"
    php artisan migrate --force
    yarn install
    yarn run production
    ```
- Makes sure everything has the right chown and chmod applied
- swaps the ```/var/www/[domain]/current``` link towards the new release to make it available with zero downtime

If any of the steps failed ```puller``` aborts before making the release current.

You can call ```puller``` from your local development machine for further integration:

```
server=[user]@[host]
dir=[deploy directory]
tag=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`    # latest tag
echo "$dir/puller $tag;" | ssh $server
```

#### rollback (generated by addzhost)
Usage: rollback [tag]

Rollback is generated by addzhost on the top project directory: ```/var/www/[domain]/rollback```

- swaps the /var/www/[domain]/current link to the old release to make it available with zero downtime

### Overview of individual installation parts run by ```setup_full```

parts are numbered to show the order in which they should be run.

#### 01 user create
create the default user and allow sudo. Block using passwords and only allow access using your public key for security.

* asks for username
* asks for ssh public key to access this account remotely. Paste the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

#### 02 set hostname
changes the hostname

#### 03 repos and yums
Add remi and epel repo, updates the system and ```yum``` the basics

#### 04 root password
secures the root user

#### 05 security
firewalls, sshd security and fail2ban - disable password logins and secure it further with ```fail2ban```

#### 06 global settings
color prompts, timezone settings, ntp server, fortune and cowsay (just for fun)

#### 07 php
Set up php 74 including fpm and composer

#### 08 node and npm
Installs node, npm and yarn

#### 09 mysql / mariadb
installs mariadb and sets it up for production

* MariaDB asks some questions during install, like the root password to be used

#### 10 nginx
set up nginx for php-fpm and prepare for multiple virtual hosts with the sites-enabled/sites-available pattern

#### 11 laravel
Actually no laravel project is installed, but everything is prepared for adding a zero-downtime-deployment project using the ```addzhost``` command

#### 12 redis
Optionally install redis

#### Finally
logout as root. At this moment the server is ready for project deployments but none is deployed yet.


### extra utilities in ~/bin 
* artisan - shortcut to ```php artisan```
* clear-laravel -  clears all possible caches and restores path permissions
* logtail - tails the latest laravel log for a live logview (from any laravel top directory)
* dbRemote2local - copy a remote mysql database to a local database
